<p class="crimsontext">Master Lock 8320D Keyed U-Lock</p>
<p>I used this as a <span class="tealtext">lock for a bike</span>. That's it's primary use. But it's <span class="tealtext">strong</span>, and unless your kids can pick an unpickable lock or cut through it with a circular saw, it should do the trick. After buying this, your kids won't be eating any food. Rest assured.</p>

<p>First off <span class="tealtext">always feed those kids</span>. But if you had to lock up stored food or other items that you did not want to be eaten or messed with then this lock can stop any young child from opening the refrigerator door. My advise on those kids entering your fridge would be to explain to them that taking certain items from the fridge is not okay. I hope this helps you.</p>

<p>I think this lock is quite big for that. If you have large loops, then maybe yes.</p>
	
<p>Do not use this as a bike/motorcycle lock. <span class="tealtext">It is very low quality</span>, easy to break in to and has a very short life span. Disc locks are just as cheap and offer much more protection.</p>

</p>This locks uses a <span class="tealtext">high security key</span> that is not easy to have duplicated. It does come with 2 keys, but if you are needing more than 2 keys you might want to buy another lock.</p>
